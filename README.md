# Machine Learning Model for Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project involves creating a machine learning model to predict stock prices using TensorFlow Keras. The process includes data preprocessing, building a neural network model with Dense, Dropout, and LSTM layers, training and testing the model, and deploying it as a real-time web application using Streamlit.

## Project Info

### Required Tools
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, yFinance, Streamlit
- **Deployment**: Streamlit (for web application)

### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Ingestion**: Use `yfinance` to fetch historical stock price data.
- **Cleaning**: Handle missing values and outliers.
- **Normalization**: Scale data for better model performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepare features for the LSTM model, such as creating lag features.

### Model Creation
- **Define the Model**: Use TensorFlow Keras to create a Sequential model.
- **Add Layers**:
  - **Dense Layers**: For fully connected layers.
  - **Dropout Layers**: To prevent overfitting.
  - **LSTM Layers**: For handling sequential data.
- **Compile the Model**: Set the optimizer, loss function, and metrics.

### Predicting Values from the Model
- **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to forecast stock prices.
- **Visualize Results**: Plot predictions against actual stock prices for comparison.

### Saving the Model
- Save the trained model to disk for future use using `model.save()`.

### Deploying the Model as a Web Application
- **Create Web Application**: Develop a Streamlit application to provide real-time predictions.
- **Integrate Model**: Load the saved model and use it for real-time predictions within the web application.
- **Deploy to Hosting Platform**: Deploy the Streamlit app to a cloud service or local server.

## Technologies Used
